Motor control featuring toggglable throttling of the vertical
thrusters as they have caused brown outs in motor pi

This code is meant to be run on motor pi and requires
a connected arduino mega

The ip of server pi must be specified in the
webSocketClient.start call at the bottom of this file
port is 8008 and is specified in webSocketClient.py

Required 3rd-party libraries:
`autobahn`
`twisted`
`pyfirmata`
